3. Are file names of ADSes changeable and would leaving them be a security risk?
4. Complete pattern wiping.
   -Code implemented to define and add new methods
   -Implement saving to the registry
     -CustomErasureMethod not serializable

8. Fix internationalized code. GUI elements may run into each other.
   -Decide: when do we translate code which are exception messages?

===Questions===
1. More intelligent default settings selection
2. Can't we filter variable names out of getText pots? We also need to add exception
   strings and such stuff from the other projects.

===Annoyances===
1. Progress calculation when cluster tip erasure is disabled
